## Background

### Problem Context
Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) is fundamental to achieving economic growth while minimizing environmental degradation. SDG 12 calls for responsible use of resources to ensure long-term sustainability. Current consumption patterns, particularly in high-income nations, contribute to excessive waste, resource depletion, and environmental harm. Meanwhile, developing regions face challenges in implementing sustainable production due to economic and technological constraints.

The shift towards sustainability requires systemic changes across industries, governments, and consumer behavior. Key challenges include:
- Overreliance on non-renewable resources
- Inefficiencies in production leading to high waste generation
- Carbon-intensive supply chains
- Lack of incentives for circular economy adoption

### Significance of the Study
Addressing SCP is critical for:
1. Reducing ecological footprints by minimizing waste and pollution.
2. Enhancing economic resilience through sustainable business models.
3. Ensuring long-term resource availability by promoting circular economies.
4. Aligning industrial production with climate goals to mitigate global warming.
5. Improving social well-being by reducing environmental hazards and promoting responsible consumption.

### Research Objectives
This study aims to:
1. Analyze global patterns in resource consumption and waste generation.
2. Identify key determinants of successful sustainable production practices.
3. Evaluate the impact of SCP policies on environmental and economic indicators.
4. Forecast the future trajectory of SCP adoption using scenario modeling.
