# Ensuring Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns

## Executive Summary
This project addresses the need for sustainable consumption and production patterns, as outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12. Through comprehensive analysis of consumption, waste, and production data, this project aims to identify key drivers of unsustainable practices and recommend actionable interventions for both consumers and businesses. The focus is on promoting responsible resource use, reducing waste, and advancing circular economy principles globally.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Sustainable Consumption Index (SCI)**
   - Measures the percentage of goods and services consumed in alignment with sustainability criteria.
   - Target: Increase the sustainable consumption share by 5% annually.
   - Baseline: Current global share of sustainable goods consumption is 20%.

2. **Waste Reduction Rate (WRR)**
   - Tracks the percentage of waste diverted from landfills and incineration through recycling, composting, or repurposing.
   - Target: Achieve a 50% reduction in waste sent to landfills by 2030.
   - Monitored annually through waste management data.

3. **Circular Economy Score (CES)**
   - Measures the extent to which production systems are designed to be circular, focusing on reuse, recycling, and sustainable product design.
   - Target: Achieve a circular economy score of 8/10 for all regions.
   - Evaluated every two years based on industrial sector practices.

4. **Energy Efficiency in Production (EEP)**
   - Assesses the energy consumption per unit of production across industries.
   - Target: Reduce energy consumption per unit of production by 15% by 2030.
   - Monthly assessment based on energy usage data from manufacturing sectors.

5. **Carbon Footprint Reduction Rate (CFRR)**
   - Tracks the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with production processes.
   - Target: Achieve a 25% reduction in carbon footprint by 2030.
   - Measured annually with carbon emissions data from industrial sectors.
